# deontic-logic-with-unknowns-haskell

This is an implementation of an action-based deontic logic language that allows for unknowns, i.e. a partial logic of norms, in Haskell (see https://github.com/shaunazzopardi/deontic-logic-with-unknowns for an object-oriented implementation in C#). This allows for conflict analysis between norms in a complex contract (e.g. the obligation to open a door conflicts between the prohibition to open a door). The semantics are described in:
